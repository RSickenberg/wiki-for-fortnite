//  README: You need to add only one weapon for all of his levels like (AR + Details for Grey level) -> (Details for green level) -> (Details for blue level) /!\ DON'T FORGET THE WEAPONID TO MATCH THE DETAILS WITH THE WEAPON
//          Grey : color 0 / detailLevel 0
//          Green : color 1 / detailLevel 1
//          Blue : color 2 / detailLevel 2
//          Purple : color 3 / detailLevel 3
//          Gold :  color 4 / detailLevel 4
//
//
//  Since 3.4, weapons can have dissociated style, or colors, like: green / blue
//  For new methods, please, take note of this.
